<h1>Remote Testing Ant Targets</h1>

<p> These targets create a remote job that will zip up all the p4 opened
files on your local machine, sync to the head, sync/resolve
your changes into the label, build what it needs and runs the requested test(s). Targets named with wls(eg, remote.standard.wls) will create a WLS RQ job to test the coherence bits build by your change after test in coherence RQ passed. You are sent email when the job starts and completes. </p>
<p>Then use the command "tools/wls/infra/enqueue" to enqueue a remote test. There are several options to enqueue that will modify its behavior.</p>
<p> An auto-submit job can be used to submit the changes if the build and test succeed. The -a option is used . Here are a few rules related to auto-submit jobs.</p>

<ul>
<li>
you must use the -c "your changelist"option to mention the local change list. Create a change using "p4 change" and specify the created change number to this option. 
<li>
you must include a comment in the change (add it when you run p4 change). You can also use the -d "your description" option but it's preferable to include it in the change definition (for example, integ'ing the change to another code line will use the description in the change). 
<li>
you must revert the change on your local client after the remote submit completes. 
</ul>

<p> NOTE: If you think a drt failure in the remote queue is machine
related, or something to do with the remote queue email the <a
href=mailto:infra-rq_cn_grp@oracle.com> Platform Infrastructure Team</a> </p>

<p>See the end of this document for the details of what labels, build
and tests are used.  To have additional tests added send email to <a
href=mailto:infra-rq_cn_grp@oracle.com> Platform Infrastructure Team</a>
supplying the details listed for the other remote tests.</p>

<p>The URL for machine and job queue...
<a href="remote.jsp">Remote Status</a></p>

<p>Shows the same thing as "remote.status" in html format.</p>

<p>Ant properties that modify what the remote targets do.  These
properties can be mixed and matched in most every combination.</p>

<h3>Details on how changes are sync/resolved</h3>

<p> First the files are sync'ed and opened to the exact file revision you
have opened in your p4 client.  The same file revisions shown in <i>p4
opened</i> command.  Next the entire client is sync'ed to the known clean
label (or -s "changelist you want to syncto") change number.  Finally three different resolve
commands are used to sync/resolve the changes.  Those commands are p4 resolve
-t -as (does binary one sided resolves), p4 resolve -am (merge most text
files), p4 resolve -dw -am (slow command but resolves various whitespace
diffs not already resolved by -am).  There is no way to to change these
sync/resolves except to sync/resolve on your own local p4 client before
submit. </p>

<h2>Test Failure Guide</h2>

<p>Your first indication of failure will be via email or from the
job.jsp status page.  If you do not immediately understand what is
going on your first stop should be the <b>Results Directory</b>.  This
is the <i>timestamped</i> directory (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS). </p>

<p>If you had a build failure then look at build.log.  If you had a
test failure then check the ant output for that failed test.  The .log
is named based on the directory and ant target the remote test
infrastructure used to run the test.  If the ant output doesn't tell
you what's wrong then you'll have to find the detailed logs and output
of the test.  The tests aren't entirely consistent about where they
put their logs but the locations in the <b>Results Directory</b>
should be anologous to where they are if you run the test locally.
We try to capture enough so you can debug most
every problem but we can't capture everything because of disk space
limitations.  Sometimes you just have to look at all_files.html and
search for your test name in the list of files.  Remember the remote queue only publishes 
logs for a test when that test fails, this is done to speed up the cycle time 
of remote runs.  If you want the test logs published regardless of the test's status, pass -p on your remote run. </p>

<p> If you need a little more detail than job.jsp gives you see
test.log, this is kind of a verbose listing of the same basic
information. </p>

<p>If you think a test failure in the remote queue is machine related,
or something to do with the remote queue email the <a
href=mailto:infra-rq_cn_grp@oracle.com> Platform Infrastructure Team</a></p>
